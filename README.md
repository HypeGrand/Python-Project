## Python_Basics: Function Collection

This file contains a collection of basic Python functions. It's perfect for beginners or anyone looking for a quick reference on common Python tasks.

### What's Inside?:

- **Input/Output**  
  Functions to get input from users and print results.

- **Math Operations**  
  Simple math functions like addition, subtraction, and more.

- **String Handling**  
  Functions to work with text, such as combining or slicing strings.

- **List Handling**  
  Basic list operations like adding, removing, and sorting items.

- **Conditional Logic**  
  Examples of `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements.

- **Loops**  
  `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks.

- **Error Handling**  
  Examples of how to catch errors with `try` and `except`.

- **Functions**  
  Reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values.

- **Object-Oriented Basics**  
  Simple class and object examples.

## AlienInvansion

Alien Invasion is a clone of a popular arcade game with the same name. This project was built to enhance my Python programming skills by following the "Python Crash Course" book. It's a fun and engaging game that challenges players to defend Earth from waves of alien invaders!

### Requirements

- **Python 3.x+**
- **Pygame**

### Controls

- **Spacebar**  
  Shoot bullets
- **Left/Right arrow keys**  
  Move the spaceship left or right

## What I Learned

In the **Alien Invasion** project, I learned key programming and game development skills:

### 1. Python Programming
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: I used classes like `Ship`, `Alien`, and `Bullet` to organize my code.
- **Game Loops**: I learned how to create a loop that checks for events, updates the game state, and refreshes the screen.
- **Modular Code**: By separating game components into different modules, I improved code organization.

### 2. Pygame Library
- **Graphics and Input**: I learned how to display images on the screen and handle keyboard input for movement and shooting.
- **Sprite Management**: I used sprite groups to manage multiple game elements like aliens and bullets efficiently.
- **Collision Detection**: I implemented logic to detect collisions between bullets and aliens or the ship.

### 3. Game Development Concepts
- **Event Handling**: I handled player input and game events (e.g., key presses and window closing).
- **Real-Time Updates**: I updated game elements like the ship and alien movement in real time.
- **Screen Rendering**: I refreshed the game screen continuously using `pygame.display.flip()`.

### 4. Problem-Solving and Debugging
- **Game Logic**: I developed the logic for player movement, shooting, and alien behavior.
- **Debugging**: I resolved issues with game mechanics, memory management, and performance.

### 5. Project Workflow
- **Version Control**: I used Git and GitHub to track changes and manage my project.
- **Documentation**: I wrote this README to explain my project clearly to others.

This project helped me understand the basics of Python, game development, and efficient coding practices.
